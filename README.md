## Details of Files Generated by `init.sh`

Here is an overview of the main files created by the script, with a focus on those fundamental for collaboration and advanced use of Copilot/AI:

- **.github/copilot-instructions.md**: 
    - Contains rules, conventions, and example prompts to guide Copilot and other AI agents in generating code and documentation.
    - **Recommended structure:**
        ```markdown
        # Instructions for Copilot/AI

        ## Project objectives
        - Clearly and concisely describe what the project should do.

        ## Style conventions
        - List formatting rules, variable names, function/class structure, etc.

        ## Example prompts
        - Provide examples of comments or requests that lead to quality code generation.
        - Example:
            ```python
            # Write a function that calculates the average of a list of numbers
            ```

        ## Documentation rules
        - How docstrings, comments, README, etc. should be written.

Customize these files according to your team's and project's needs to get the most out of Copilot and collaboration.
# Project Template with Copilot

This repository is designed as a template to quickly start new projects, leveraging the capabilities of GitHub Copilot.

## Repository Structure

- `src/` — Folder for project source code
- `docs/` — Documentation and guides
- `.gitignore` — File to exclude common files/folders
- `init.sh` — Automatic initialization script for the project structure and base files (see below)
## What `init.sh` Does

The `init.sh` script automates the creation of the repository's base structure and all fundamental files for a new project. Specifically:

- Creates the `.github/` folder with templates for issues, pull requests, contribution guidelines, security, commit conventions, and Copilot/AI instructions.
- Generates common configuration files such as `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json`, `README.md`, test files (`jest.config.js`, `setupTests.js`, `pytest.ini`), and configuration files for formatting and linting (`.editorconfig`, `.prettierrc`, `.eslintrc.json`, `.flake8`).
- Prepares templates for issues and feature requests in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
- Creates files for managing development dependencies (`requirements-dev.txt`).

**Purpose:** to speed up the startup of a new project by providing a complete and customizable base, ready to be adapted to specific needs.

**How to use:**
1. Run `bash init.sh` from the repository root.
2. Customize the generated files according to your project's needs.

**Note:** You can modify the script to add/remove files or change default content.

## How to Use This Template

1. Click on "Use this template" on GitHub to create a new repository based on this one.
2. Customize the structure according to your needs.
3. Start writing code in the `src/` folder.

## Tips & Tricks for Copilot

- **Write clear comments**: Copilot generates better code if comments are detailed.
- **Leverage suggestions**: Press `Tab` to accept, `Esc` to ignore, and `Ctrl+Space` to see more options.
- **Request complex functions**: Describe what you want to achieve, Copilot can generate entire functions or classes.
- **Refactoring**: Use Copilot to improve existing code, not just to write new code.
- **Documentation**: Ask Copilot to generate docstrings or comments for your code.

## Usage Example

```python
# src/example.py
"""Example function generated with Copilot"""
def add(a, b):
    """Returns the sum of two numbers"""
    return a + b
```
